# Roadmap

Question 1 can be found in the q1 directory, q2 is the JavaScript file in the root directory. 

There is an Assumptions file in the root directory that outlines what assumptions were made during the process of completing both questions.

## Running Q1
To run q1, Node and npm are required. 

To get started, navigate to the /CurrencyConversion/q1 directory (or clone the repo found on [Github](https://github.com/marina-dunn/CurrencyConversion)).

Run `npm install` to get the required packages.

Then to start the dev server, run `npm start` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser to interact with the application. 

Alternatively, to have the application running in production, run the following commands: 

`npm run build`

`npm install -g serve`

`serve -s build`

Then open in a Chrome-based browser and view at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).



## Running Q2
To run Q2.js: in a terminal traverse to the directory that contains the file Q2 (or run the file with the filepath), then run the following command:

`node Q2.js`

The output will be in the console. 

If testing other values, change the values within the testing cases of the file, then run the file again the same way.
