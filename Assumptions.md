# Q1 Assumptions
- Since I could no longer use the link for the countries that was provided, I assume that I can use a different set of country data. 
- Assume that the app is being run on chrome or chrome-based browser.
- Assume that since I am using the free version of fixer.io, that the base currency has to be Euros(because the free version only allows the base currency to be Euros).

# Q2 Assumptions
- Assume that if the series requires an even or odd number, that adding 1 to the number will fix the problem. Then continue incrementing with the SeriesIncrement from there. 
- Because the function is inclusive on the seriesStart and seriesEnd, if the seriesIncrement is larger than the range between the start and end, that the function will run only on the start. 
- Assume that the series start and end will be within the provided ranges. 
- Assume that the provided inputs will be integers and not strings (i.e. that the input will be valid).
- Assume that the specifiedDigit will be in the range of 0 to 9.
